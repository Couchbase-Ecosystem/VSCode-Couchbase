Use the **fuzziness** property to run a fuzzy query.

The **fuzziness** property uses your specified edit distance to match terms based on their similarity, rather than exact matches.

You can set **fuzziness** to a maximum value of 2.

Use the **fuzziness** property with the term property for a term query or the match property for a match query.
