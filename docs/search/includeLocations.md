To return the position of each occurrence of a search term inside a document, set **includeLocations** to true.

**Note**: You must have *Include Term Vectors* enabled or the **include_term_vectors** property set to true on a field to use **includeLocations**. For more information about how to enable term vectors, see Child Field Options or Search Index JSON Properties.
