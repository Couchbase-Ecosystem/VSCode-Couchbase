Use the **conjuncts** array to specify multiple child queries in a single query object.

You can use the **conjuncts** array inside a must object or directly inside a query object.

If you use the **conjuncts** array, every query object in the array must have a match in a document to include the document in search results.

You can create objects in a **conjuncts** array to describe any of the available query types.
